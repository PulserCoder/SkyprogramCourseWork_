### What about typing?
Almost all of the functions have detail typing and special type of view, type of data and etc.
Also I have tryed to take some new types of data from module typing
_(For example: TypedDict)_ 
I did it for better understanding what I do in my code
#### Please check it and give me some feedback about it.
